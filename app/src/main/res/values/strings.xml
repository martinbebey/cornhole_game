        Each player stands and throws four bean bags from behind each cornhole board. Opposing players
        alternate throwing bags. No points are awarded to any bags that touch the ground. After the
        four bags are tossed by each player, the points are tallied and the positive difference in
        points (e.g. 3 points scored by blue and 4 points scored by red, the difference would be 1
        point for red) is added to the teamâ€™s overall points total.

        There are two ways to score the game to determine the winner:\n\n
        1. The first team to reach 21 points, but must win by 2 points. \n\n
        2. The first team to score 21 points exactly. If a team exceeds 21 points, their point total
        will be reverted back to 11 points. \n\n
        You can pick how the game is won in the menu when you start scoring a game.
